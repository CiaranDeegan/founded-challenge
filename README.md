## Description

Having only ever used browserify, I found webpack to be a lot more complicated to set up. Having said that, I can see that it is quite a bit more flexible than browserify and I may consider moving some of my own projects over to webpack.

This project was completed in less than a day. I had never used React before now but I did see a lot of similarities with VueJS.

Managing state was not too complex in this instance, but I could see it getting messy quite quickly. Redux would be well suited to larger projects.
